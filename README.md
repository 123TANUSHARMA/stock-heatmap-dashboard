# 📊 Stock Heatmap Dashboard

## 🚀 Overview
The **Stock Heatmap Dashboard** is a dynamic and interactive web application that visually represents stock market data using a heatmap. The dashboard is built using **Next.js, React, D3.js, and the Polygon API** to fetch real-time stock data. It provides a powerful visualization tool to track stock performance at a glance.

## 🔥 Features
- **Real-time stock data** powered by **Polygon API**.
- **Heatmap visualization** using **D3.js** for intuitive stock performance insights.
- **Filtering and sorting options** to analyze specific stocks.
- **Dark & Light mode** for enhanced user experience.
- **Responsive design** for seamless viewing on all devices.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization:** D3.js
- **Backend:** Node.js (if needed for caching data)
- **API:** Polygon API
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
